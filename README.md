### Supervised Machine Learning: Predicting Rent Prices

The goal of this project was to predict rent prices in Switzerland given a provided
data set. Four supervised machine learning models were trained on the training set
and then compared to each other. The model with the best performance, regarding
a selection of metrics, was then used to predict the test set.
